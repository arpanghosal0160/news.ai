News Summarizer App (Markdown)
This document outlines a simple News Summarizer App that utilizes various libraries to deliver the latest news based on voice input, summarized and read aloud for user convenience.

Features
Voice Input: Captures user queries through speech recognition.
News Fetching: Employs the GNews API to find relevant news articles.
Summarization: Leverages Hugging Face's Transformers library for news content summarization.
Text-to-Speech: Reads the summarized news articles aloud using pyttsx3.
Installation
Clone or Download the Repository:

Clone the repository from your terminal using git clone https://github.com/arpanghosal0160/news.ai
Alternatively, download the project files and navigate to the directory using cd news-summarizer.
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

For improved project management, creating a virtual environment is recommended. You can achieve this with:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Dependencies:

Install all necessary packages using pip install -r requirements.txt. This file should be included in the project directory.
Obtain GNews API Key:

Sign up for an account on GNews.io (https://gnews.io/) to acquire your unique API key.
Configure GNews API Key:

Locate the news_fetcher.py file and replace the placeholder API_KEY with your obtained key from GNews.io:

Python

API_KEY = "your_gnews_api_key_here"  # Replace with your GNews API key
Run the App:

Once everything is set up, execute the app using:

Bash

python main.py
How it Works
Voice Input:

The app utilizes speech recognition to listen and capture the user's query (e.g., "Technology").
Fetch News:

Based on the voice input, the GNews API is employed to retrieve relevant news articles.
Summarize:

The Transformers library from Hugging Face is used to process and summarize the gathered news content.
Text-to-Speech:

pyttsx3 converts the condensed news summary into an audio format, reading it aloud for the user.

The application relies on the following Python libraries:

requests: Allows making API requests.
pyttsx3: Enables text-to-speech functionality.
speechrecognition: Captures user voice input.
transformers: Provides tools for text summarization.
torch: Supports the execution of Hugging Face models.
